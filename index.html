        <center>Baldur's Gate III is a modern RPG based on the Dungeon's and Dragons universe. It does an amazing job emmersing you in the different quests, side quests, and battles. Getting you attached to the characters and rightfully earning the title of "Game of the Year" in 2023 <B>"Based on the fifth edition rules of the tabletop game Dungeons & Dragons (D&D 5e), several mechanics are identical between the two. A major feature is that outcomes are decided by rolling a twenty-sided die (d20). Some rolls occur with "advantage" or "disadvantage", meaning two d20s are rolled and the player receives the best or worst result, respectively."</B> (Snippet from the WIki explaining the mechanics of the game and how they relate to D&D)</center>

    <center>Above you can see what are called <em>"classes"</em> though they are limited in the game compared to the vast amount in D&D, you can pick from quite a few. Your class determines your abilities, strengths and weaknesses. On top of this selection, you can customize your character's skills to your liking. If you want to make a pirate-thief, a water wizard, or a viking inspired barbarian, it's all available with the skills settings!</center>
     <center><h2>Inspiration </h2></center>
    <center>What I think is the most interesting quality of the game is the inspiration it takes from other works of fiction. Reddit user "u/DontMakeMeGreg" put together this helpful chart to understand the orgins of the games content!</center>

<center><body>Because of the many inspirations from D&D, Dragon Age, Pathfinder, and Divinity, the gameplay is sort of like a board game, especially when you're in battle.</body></center>
<center><h2>Plot</h2></center>
<body>The game's plot follows the player's character "Tav" who wakes up on a mind flayer's Nautaloid ship mid crash, with a special guest in their brain. A mind flayer's parasite. Supposedly, your character has only a matter of days before they become a mind flayer themselves. Through the course of the game, you
find that your parasite is different from every other parasite you've encountered. Why haven't you transformed? Why don't the mind flayers have control over you? YOu spend the game trying to solve this mystery, and save the world from the evil cult of the Absolute! YOu team up with a ragtag group od adventurers who
share your same problem and set off for the city of Baldur's Gate. On the way each character experiences a major arc and evolves as a person thanks to your "Tav" Similar to D&D, you choose your fate, you choose your ending. In this game, you can either side with the "Absolute" and destroy the world, or with the power of 
friendship and copyrighted forgotten realms spells, defeat the Absolute once and for all!</body>
